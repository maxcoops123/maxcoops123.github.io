Welcome to my website!

A little bit about me, I am a Geography and Environmental Systems Major From UMBC. I have spent my college years learning about Ecology, Meteorology, GIS, Climate Science, and much more. At the top of the page you will see various links to things like my resume and a little portfolio of a few things i have worked on. I have expereince working with lots of GIS programs like ArcPro, ArcGIS Online, QGIS, Rstudio, and Github. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy pursuing various outdoor activities. You'll often find me skateboarding, snowboarding, or surfing, depending on the season. When I'm not outdoors, I like to hit the gym and lift weights to stay fit and healthy.

On this website, you'll find examples of my work, including GIS projects and maps that I've created. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, so please feel free to get in touch if you'd like to collaborate on a project or just say hello.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work and learning more about me.
