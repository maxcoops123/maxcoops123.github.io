Using the qgis2web plugin on QGIS i was able to create this interactive web map on various skatepark locations. You can click through the layers and see things like if the park has lights or what kind of material the park is made out of. If your not much of skater, parks with lights are very favorable because you can keep skating after the sun goes down, but most park lights are dim and it can get dangerus dropping in on a dark mini ramp. The surface material is also important, usually smooth fresh concrete will have no cracks or loose rocks that can catch your wheel. This data was taken from Overpass Turbo an open source GIS website. Another thing to note is this is only showing skateparks and not skate spots. Some of the most popular places in skating are random places with good skateable features, like Freedom Plaza in DC. This place almost always has people skating there even though its not a park. It is probably the most famous place East Coast skating wise.

This map has a few layers you can click on and off in the top right, you can also click on the points to find out more information like what type of material the park is made out off and if there is lights.
